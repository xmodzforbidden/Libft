Libft is a custom implementation of standard C library functions, created as part of the 42 curriculum. This project aims to deepen understanding of C programming by recreating commonly used functions from scratch.

## Features

- Standard library functions (e.g., `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`)
- Memory management functions (e.g., `malloc`, `free`, `memset`)
- String manipulation functions (e.g., `strdup`, `strjoin`, `strsplit`)
- Linked list manipulation functions
- Additional utility functions

    ```
3. Compile the library:
